## About The Project:

The Diamond Price Prediction project is an end-to-end machine learning venture that aims to forecast diamond prices. Diamonds are extremely costly jewels, and their prices can vary dramatically depending on a variety of circumstances. This project intends to use machine learning techniques to generate accurate diamond price predictions, thereby providing significant information to both buyers and sellers in the diamond industry.

## About the Data:

The dataset The goal is to predict the price of a given diamond (Regression Analysis).

There are 10 independent variables (including id):

- carat: Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds.

- cut: Quality of Diamond Cut

- color: Color of Diamond

- clarity: Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification.

- depth: The depth of the diamond is its height (in millimetres) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (top surface)

- table: A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up.

- x : Diamond X dimension

- y: Diamond Y dimension

- z: Diamond Z dimension

## Target variable:

- price: Price of the Diamond.

## Technologies used:

- Pandas

- Numpy

- Scikit-learn

- Flask

- CD Pipelines

- MLFlow

- Seaborn

- Matplotlib

# Getting Started

To set up a local copy, follow these simple steps. Significantly depends on a variety of circumstances. This research intends to use machine learning techniques to accurately estimate diamond values, providing significant information to both buyers and sellers in the diamond market.

## Installation Steps

### Installation from GitHub

Follow these steps to install and set up the project directly from the GitHub repository:

1. ***Clone the Repository****
